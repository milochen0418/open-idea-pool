In the near future, artificial intelligence will replace human work, 
and on this basis human beings must develop their new work and new social forms. Therefore, 
a new generation of human beings must learn to use the tool of artificial intelligence, 
and on this basic tool, create new jobs and new social forms.

For this reason, 
children must recognize artificial intelligence as early as possible, 
understand how to use it to help learn, and use it to work when they grow up.

'AI for Kids' education system is dedicated to helping children around the world understand 
and use artificial intelligence. Departure from Taiwan, 
then into China as a whole and finally into the world.

Currently I am looking for a job and I am also creating this educational system. 
If you agree with this educational system, 
we welcome friends and colleagues from all walks of life to join together with funds and manpower.
